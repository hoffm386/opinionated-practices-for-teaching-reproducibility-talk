# Data Science:

### *the study and development of reproducible and auditable processes to obtain insight from data*

---

## Key things for teaching reproducibility

--

### 1. Extra emphasis on motivation

--

### 2. Direct instruction

--

### 3. Lots of practice!!!

## Examples of how we motivate learning

--

### 1. Tell stories from the trenches

--

### 2. Let them fail (in a controlled manner)

--

### 3. Case studies of failures with real world consequences

Give students a data analysis pipeline project on GitHub, and ask them to run it.
They have done things like this before, but this time, we add several packages 
that they haven't used before. Let them work to install the packages and get the
analysis up and running.

Give them a second data analysis pipeline project on GitHub, and ask them to run it.
This also has several packages they haven't used before, but this time there are 
instructions for running it in a Docker container.

# Why direct instruction?

---

class: center, middle

### This is not something (most) students figure out through exploration and inquiry based learning, or at least not efficiently...

---

class: middle

### Excerpt from Roger Peng's blog post on <br> ["The Role of Theory in Data Analysis"](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/12/11/the-role-of-theory-in-data-analysis/):

#### *There is no need for a new data analyst to learn about reproducibility “from experience”. We don’t need to lead a junior data analyst down a months-long winding path of non-reproducible analyses until they are finally bitten by non-reproducibility (and therefore “learn their lesson”). We can just tell them*

#### *"In the past, we’ve found it useful to make our data analyses reproducible. Here’s a workflow to guide you in your own analyses."*

#### *With that one statement, we can “compress” over 20 years of experience.*

---

## Examples of how we use direct instruction

--

### 1. Live demos

--

### 2. Guided worksheets and tutorials

Live demonstrate how to use the GitHub website to create a repository, and a Git 
GUI to clone the repository as well as push code to the repository on GitHub.

Students then work through a worksheet, that guides them to do the same thing,
which asks them questions along the way about what they are doing at each stage
to reinforce the conceptual aspects of what they are doing.

**Artifacts for this example:**

# Why lots of practice?

---

class: middle

## There are two fundamental ways we commit things to long-term memory:

### 1. one-trial learning (requires emotional impact)

### 2. repetitive spaced training

---

class: center, middle

### However, when we teach reproducibility workflows and skills, we want students to do more than learn them, we want them to use and practice them. 

### We want to actually change their habits or behaviours.

---

### An aside: A book that has recently made me think more about how we can tangibly do this:

</a>

---

## Examples of how we embed lots of practice

--

### 1. Student practice following live demos

--

### 2. Lots of low stakes assessments with small/short problems

--

### 3. Learning technologies & platforms use authentic data science reproducibility tools

---

### Example: lots of practice!!!

**Course:** Almost all Master of Data Science courses (~ 20 courses)

We use GitHub as our course management system. Homework instructions and 
assignments are distributed to students as GitHub repositories. They have 
to submit their assignment by pushing their work to the GitHub repositories.

We also require that they have 3 commits associated with each homework 
submission.

By the end of the program, they have version controlled their work in > 80 
different repositories!!!

**Tools for using GitHub as a learning management system:**
- [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/)
- [Classy](https://github.com/ubccpsc/classy)
- [rhomboid](https://github.com/mgelbart/rhomboid)
