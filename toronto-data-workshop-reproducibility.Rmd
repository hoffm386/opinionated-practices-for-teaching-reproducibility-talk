# Data Science:

### *the study and development of reproducible and auditable processes to obtain insight from data*

---

# Key things for teaching reproducibility

--

### 1. Extra emphasis on motivation

--

### 2. Direct instruction

--

### 3. Lots of practice!!!

# Examples of how we motivate learning

--

### 1. Tell stories from the trenches

--

### 2. Let them fail (in a controlled manner)

--

### 3. Case studies of failures with real world consequences


---

# Why direct instruction?

### Very similar reasons as to why we need extra motivation. 

### This is not something (most) students figure out through exploration and inquiry based learning, or at least not efficiently...

---

### Excerpt from Roger Peng's blog post on <br> ["The Role of Theory in Data Analysis"](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/12/11/the-role-of-theory-in-data-analysis/):

#### *There is no need for a new data analyst to learn about reproducibility “from experience”. We don’t need to lead a junior data analyst down a months-long winding path of non-reproducible analyses until they are finally bitten by non-reproducibility (and therefore “learn their lesson”). We can just tell them*

#### *In the past, we’ve found it useful to make our data analyses reproducible. Here’s a workflow to guide you in your own analyses.*

#### *With that one statement, we can “compress” over 20 years of experience.*

---

# Examples of how we use direct instruction

--

### 1. Live demos

--

### 2. Guided worksheets and tutorials

# Why lots of practice?

### There are two fundamental ways we commit things to long-term memory:

1. one-trial learning (requires emotional impact)

2. repetitive spaced training

---

### However, when we teach reproducibility workflows and skills, we want students to do more than learn them, we want them to use and practice them. 

### We want to actually change their habits or behaviours.

---

# Examples of how we embed lots of practice

--

### 1. Student practice following live demos

--

### 2. Lots of low stakes assessments with small/short problems

--

### 3. Learning technologies & platforms use authentic data science reproducibility tools
